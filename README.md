Exploring Factors Influencing Infant Pneumonia Hospitalization

 Pneumonia, a respiratory infection, stands as a significant cause of mortality, particularly
 among children, claiming the lives of 22% of children aged 1 to 5 years old in 2019 (2). Both
 viral and bacterial pathogens contribute to this condition, which spreads through airborne
 droplets and bodily fluids. Manifesting with symptoms such as chest pain, headache, cough, and
 fever, pneumonia imposes a substantial burden on public health. In this analysis, I sought to
 address two questions. First and foremost, my objective was to explore whether infant diet,
 particularly the timing of weaning off the breast milk, influenced infants being hospitalized with
 pneumonia. Secondly, I sought to explore additional factors beyond infant diet that could
 influence the risk of infant pneumonia hospitalization. To achieve these objectives, I utilized data
 from The National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, collected by the U.S. Bureau of Labor
 Statistics. This dataset comprises information gathered through interviews conducted with 3,470
 mothers between 1979 and 1986 (1). By analyzing this rich dataset, we aimed to gain insights
 into the determinants of infant pneumonia hospitalization and contribute to our understanding of
 factors affecting child health outcomes. The variables in the dataset and their descriptions can be
 found in Table 1.
 
 During the initial data exploration phase, summary statistics were computed for all
 variables. On average, infants were around 9-10 months old when hospitalized with pneumonia,
 while mothers had a mean age of 21.6 years at childbirth (Table 2). Infants were also typically
 weaned off breastmilk at an average age of 1.93 months and introduced to solid food at an
 average age of 1.12 months. Notably, only 2% of infants in the dataset were hospitalized with
 pneumonia. This indicates a heavily censored dataset, as evident in the ever so slight decrease
 followed by a plateau observed in the Kaplan-Meier survival curve presented in Figure 2.
 Turning our attention to the cumulative hazard curve in Figure 2, we confirm that the risk of
 getting hospitalized with pneumonia increases over time. Additionally, boxplots were generated
 to explore relationships between variables. Although most did not reveal significant trends, a
 trend can be seen regarding maternal age. The interquartile range was lower for mothers with a
 positive hospitalization status, suggesting a potential association between younger maternal age
 and higher rates of pneumonia hospitalization (Figure 1). This insight will be considered in
 subsequent analyses
